Full Spectrum Warrior

Makes cover super-effective like the 2004 video game. 
I recommend you play on easy.

Changes:

- Increased effectiveness of cover (to an unrealistic degree)
- Equalized HP of AI and Human players on all difficulties
- Reduced HP difference between low and high tier infantry
- Increased time between bursts, reduced burst length of automatic fire

(MP only)

- Increased Squad manpower
- Increased AT weapon availability in assault squads and AT teams
- Reduced CP cost of infantry units
